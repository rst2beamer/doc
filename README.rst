rst2beamer sphinx doc hosting
=============================

This repository is used to host builds of the rst2beamer sphinx-generated
documentation for various releases.  The hosted documentation can be
viewed `here <http://rst2beamer.github.com/>`_.

These documents themselves are maintained as a `git repository <https://github.com/rst2beamer/doc>`_ on github, using the `github project pages feature <http://pages.github.com/>`_.

The actual rst2beamer code is in a separate repository, which is currently
hosted `here <https://github.com/ryanGT/rst2beamer>`_. However, we are in the
process of moving the repository to live under the github `rst2beamer
organization <https://github.com/rst2beamer>`_.

How to build sphinx docs
------------------------

Once the rst2beamer project officially moves to the github rst2beamer
organization, this section will be updated.
